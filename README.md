## 👽 About the human behind the code

Hi, I'm Julia (or Iuliia)! 
I'm a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics and a Cambridge alum.

- I'm working with large-scale astronomical data, building pipelines, modeling and visualizing in Python.
- I'm skilled in data analysis, statistics, and scientific storytelling — of course with the help of a clean code.
- If black hole data couldn't fool me, nothing will.

🧠 Fluent in data ✨ In love with science 🐍 C2 in Python
